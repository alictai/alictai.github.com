<p>Hello world! I am a program manager at Microsoft working on Visual Studio Team Services and a part-time student at the University of Washington in the Human-Centered Design and Engineering masters. I have a passion for integrating user research and feedback into how we build software products. The opportunity we have to create great experiences and positively impact business metrics simply by listening to customers is something we should be taking better advantage of.</p>
<p> Outside of work, I've tried all the bubble tea in NYC, braved the snow of Boston, and am currently dancing and snowboarding around the great Pacific Northwest. Running, traveling, and eating nachos are my game. Think you can keep up?</p>
