	Alison is one of the very few New Yorkers with a penchant for tourists and the phrase "y'all". Fresh Meadows, Queens where she learned to walk and talk, but she considers Mount Kisco, Westchester, where she has lived since she was 7-years-old, her hometown. Alison especially loves telling stories and is always looking for people who will listen to them.

	Currently at Tufts University, Alison is a sophomore engineer majoring in Computer Science, a Resident Assistant in a freshman dorm, a member of Tufts Christian Fellowship (TCF), and a producer and stage manager for Tufts Pen, Paint, and Pretzels (3Ps).</p>
